# Delivery Partners Integration

## Delivery Partners

A Delivery partner is a third party organization that delivers the goods on behalf of the merchant. This makes fulfillment process for small to medium enterprises quick and easy especially for those businesses that has no dedicated internal delivery team. Enabling this feature makes the vendor cost-efficient towards goods delivery.
