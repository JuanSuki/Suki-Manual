# Inventory Integration

## Store Inventory

Inventory is the collection of unsold products waiting to be sold. It is listed as the current asset of the business. The inventory increases with purchases and decreases with sales or consumption. It is important to keep track of the changes in the inventory so that vendors can evaluate their business performance.
